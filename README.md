## Automated Build Process

The following graph shows what happens between a PKGBUILD getting changed in git
and the built package being available in the pacman repo.

```

### Security Considerations

Assuming changes to PKGBUILDs are properly reviewed, the pacman signature
checking works, the upstream source is OK and all MSYS2 organization members are
trusted we need to consider a bad actor controlling some part of the building
process between the PKGBUILD getting changed and the package ending up signed in
the pacman repo.

A bad actor would need to get a package on the machine of the developer signing
the package and adding it to the pacman repo. We take the following precautions:

* We only build packages automatically with GitHub Actions without third party
  actions, excluding the official GitHub ones. We assume the GHA images and
  official actions are safe.
* The download tool used by the person signing the package checks that the
  binaries where uploaded by a restricted set of GitHub users or GHA.
  We assume the bad actor doesn't have git push rights.
* Packages too large for GHA get built/signed by MSYS2 developers on their
  machines. We assume the developer machines are safe.
* We enforce 2FA for the MSYS2 organization to make account takeovers of
  existing MSYS2 developers harder.
